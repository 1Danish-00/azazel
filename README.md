# Telegram-UserBot


Just coz I'm too lazy, I program it, to make stuff easier.

This is a userbot, which is equivalent to a telegram client, and it can run on the cloud too.<br/><br/>

Get your api-id(API_KEY in my code), API_HASH from my.telegram.org. <br/><br/>

Use them as config vars in Heroku<br/><br/>

Commands available(this list might be outdated too):
    .delmsg                      Deletes the last typed message
    .purgeme number              Deletes last n messages sent by you
